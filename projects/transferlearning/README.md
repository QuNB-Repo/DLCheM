**Transfer Learning From Embedding to Atomic/Molecular Property**

1) Linear regression - lrregression

   
3) sklearn's mlp tool - multi-layer perceptron (feedforward neural net)

   
4) size-extensive neural net - a neural network design that trains on the sum of atomisitic contributions from each embedding
