# DLCheM - What is the chemical logic behing graph neural network (GNN) chemistry

2) gcnn_latentspace_reactions               - This subproject shows how the latent space of a trained GNN model obeys 
                                            chemical reaction syntax, here we run reactions in a database to see 
                                            what would the reactions look like in the latent space of a trained 
                                            GNN model. This reveals that the latent space is organized based on 
                                            reaction syntax, we can drive all reactants of a certain kind to their 
                                            products with a single, constanct vector, for all the reactants. For
                                            example, alcohol to carbonyl oxidation, is represented by a single vector 
                                            for all alcohol reactants (the vector representing oxidation, -H2). 
                                            is true for any reaction chosen. The algorithm in this project is able 
                                            to to run any reactions in a database and analyze the embeddings of
