# DLCheM - What is the chemical logic behing graph neural network (GNN) chemistry


1) gcnn_latentspace_chemistry     - This subproject shows how the latent space of a trained model
                                    is a space that is organized on a framework of molecular environments, a.k.a functional groups. It is so precise, it quantifies the difference between local functional groups. This allows the algorithm to identify the local structures of chemistry, thus basing the decision on this fundamental concept. We explore the chemical organization of this space and its ability to quantify molecular similarity


This project has one main file, which extracts the latent space of a trained model, a.k.a embedding space, and analysis tools which analyze the latent space with dimension reduction, classification, euclidean distance, and more
