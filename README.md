# DLCheM - Can we learn chemistry from interpreting SchNet Neural Networks? 

 Inside this directory there are two main projects:

	1) extractembeddings - this code can extract embedding vectors, the representation of atom-in-molecules built by SchNet's graph convolutional neural network.  

 	2) transferlearning - this code contains simple statistical methods (linear regression, feedforward neural nets, and atomwise size-extensive neural nets) that can transfer learn, 
                              from embeddings to atomistic or molecular properties of molecules
