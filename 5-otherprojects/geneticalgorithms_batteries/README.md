#Genetic Algorithms on Bipyridine-Type Batteries

This is an application of genetic machine learning model on bipyridine-type molecules.
The first code runs a random generation of molecules (run-random-gen) and the second code (run-GA)
runs a genetic algorithm on the molecules that have been computed to have the best electronic properties
for a battery (based on cell potential, solubility, and stability)
